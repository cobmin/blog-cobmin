## Overview

"Watercolor Dreams" is a collection of my first watercolor drawings, reflecting my emotions and inspirations. Each piece is a personal expression and a step in my learning journey as an artist. For now, I will only be making the mints 1 of 1 NFTs as I find this similar to owning a real painting, and it helps create rarity for owners. You can view and purchase my collection on LoopExchange: [Watercolor Dreams](https://loopexchange.art/collection/watercolordreams).

### Hello all ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest creative endeavor, "Watercolor Dreams," with you. This collection represents my journey into the world of digital watercolor art, and I'm thrilled to offer you a glimpse into my process, inspirations, and growth as an artist.

## My Artistic Tools and Learning Path

### Tools of the Trade

I create my artworks using an 11-inch [iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/) and an [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2D3AM/A/apple-pencil-pro?fnode=07adaee9ff17deb396855e4346b28c84f4ad0c20a84be10e6db182a89c27c8071e2faeae07882be5a9bae64b224d42abb3a50cb91161a160e686070b2359244ad8379cc211c31a461d68d0a0b5728b3539667ee86df75d3b9637f2c3b5678c65), with [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) as my primary software. I really enjoy using the iPad because of the ability to paint anywhere, easily change colors, undo mistakes, and experiment with different brushes. This flexibility allows me to expand my style and refine my workflow with ease.

### Learning and Inspiration

My art education is informal, consisting mainly of watching YouTube tutorials by talented artists like [Judith](https://youtube.com/@judittyart?si=k4j6p3oF1071KxW2). Her work inspires me, and I often try to emulate her style while infusing my unique touch. I like to express my creative side and find drawing and coloring relaxing. The watercolor style, in particular, allows a lot of flexibility in how a piece can turn out, which I find exciting.

## My Creative Process

### Workflow Overview

To refine my workflow and improve my skill set, I aim to create at least one piece per week. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of my process so far:

1 **Selecting a Piece**: My subject matter is often influenced by my current interests and feelings. For instance, my piece titled "Cob Classico" was inspired by a recent trip to Italy, while "Apeâ€™s Delight" reflects my interest in [GameStop](https://www.drsgme.org/).

2 **Drawing a Template**: I sometimes use templates from tutorials or leverage AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to help create them.

3 **Choosing a Style**: I have found that I have two distinct styles (so far). One involves detailed pencil work visible in the final piece, as seen in "Space Sentinel." The other style minimizes pencil detail, focusing more on shading and blending, as in "Cob Classico." Occasionally, I combine both styles in a single piece.

4 **Creating Metadata**: I use AI to help name my pieces and write descriptions. While I currently use standard attributes/properties, I plan to add more detailed metadata in the future, such as the time spent on each piece or the creation date.

5 **Minting and Listing**: Once a piece is complete, I mint it as an NFT on [Loopring](https://loopring.io/#/) and list it on [LoopExchange](https://loopexchange.art/). I then promote it on [X](https://x.com/cobmin).

### Recent Pieces

Here are a couple of my recent artworks (as of July 5th):

#### Space Sentinel

This piece showcases detailed pencil work, capturing the intricate design of a space satellite.

#### Cob Classico

Inspired by a trip to Italy, this piece uses shading and blending techniques to create a serene, classic wine bottle scene.

## Pricing and Custom Commissions

Iâ€™ve been incrementally raising the price of each new piece by 5-10 LRC. My latest piece sold for 50 LRC (~$7 USD). As my skills improve and demand increases, I plan to continue this pricing strategy. Additionally, Iâ€™m open to creating custom pieces starting at 100 LRC. Feel free to reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/cobmin) for commissions.

## Future Plans and Goals

Iâ€™m committed to improving my skills and expanding my collection. In addition to creating new pieces weekly, I plan to enhance the metadata for each artwork to provide more insight into my creative process. This may include details like the time spent on each piece or the creation date.

## Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this artistic journey. ["Watercolor Dreams"](https://loopexchange.art/collection/watercolordreams) is more than just a collection; it's a reflection of my growth and passion for art. Stay tuned for more pieces, and feel free to reach out for custom artwork!
