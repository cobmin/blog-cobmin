I am the creator of two passion projects, [Maize](https://maizehelps.art/) and [Cob's Farm](https://www.cobsfarm.com/).

My interests are diverse and include blockchain, AI, the stock market, real estate, and philosophy.

In my free time, I enjoy visiting parks and botanical gardens, exploring breweries and wineries, and attending live music events. Sharing these experiences with my wife makes them even more special.
